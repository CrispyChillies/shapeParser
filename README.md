## DOCUMENTATION

### BASIC USAGE
Our program is implemented, compiled and run using Visual Studio Code. For that reason, we will show you the basic usage of this program using VSCode.
Make sure you have installed VSCode on your system.

#### Step 1: Open VSCode and move to the Shapes folder
You just need to open VSCode and move to the Shapes folder as usual. Notice that you need to move to the Shapes folder, not the shapeParser folder.

#### Step 2: Compile the source code of the library into a dynamic library that is compatible with your system
You need to compile the source code inside the src subfolder of the Shapes folder into a dynamic library. Then, you need to place the dynamic library outside of the build folder and still inside the Shapes folder as I've already set up the main project to link appropriately with the dynamic library in this way.
